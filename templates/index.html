        <h2>Why Bodhya?</h2>
        <p>The tech ecosystem in India is growing rapidly. For too long, most opportunities flowed towards metros and IITs while overlooking the immense potential within Bihar. Students from tier-2 and tier-3 colleges, especially in Bihar, rarely get a fair shot. Talent is universal, but opportunity is not. until now, Bodhya exists to build the bridge.</p>
        <p>Since January 2026, Bodhya has been changing that story by ending barriers and ensuring that the grit, talent, and ambition of Bihar don't just get a fair shot, but a center stage in the future of technology.</p>

        <h2>Bodhya for Non-profits Organisations</h2>

        <p>Many nonprofits are stuck in scattered spreadsheets, manual donor reports, and systems that no one on the team really owns. Bodhya Consulting helps NPOs move to simple, maintainable systems for program data, donor reporting, HR, and field operations, built on open-source stacks your team can actually understand and run.</p>
