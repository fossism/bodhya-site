For years, I've watched countless youth from Bihar, like myself, leave our homes in search of better opportunities. Even now, most students look at migration as the only way to realize their potential. But what if that could change?

## The Problem

By 2021, Bihar's government managed to establish engineering colleges in every district. The goal: give students technical education close to home. Yet, the missing piece remains. The actual tech industry, local jobs, and a career path within Bihar are not present. As a result, the cycle continues: students get degrees, but with no companies to join, everyone leaves for cities like Bangalore, Delhi, and Pune.
During my time at FOSS United, I've witnessed how open source communities can spark change in cities and colleges. But I have struggled to find people ready to lead, learn, and build a vibrant tech scene at home, despite the number of engineering colleges. The interest, and the culture just wasn't there.

## Introducing Bodhya

That's where Bodhya comes in. This initiative is my experiment to break the cycle and offer experience & real opportunities, right here. The vision? Train and mentor students, connect them with industry, and help them start their careers while they're still in college without leaving their home.

## The Plan

**Training**: The heart of the program is the training: workshops, mentorship, and practical guidance from industry experts all over India. The plan is to partner with colleges in Bihar, bring in technology leaders from major Indian cities, and connect students with industry to find internship and full-time job opportunities.

**Meetups & Conferences**: Regular events will connect students with industry professionals, organize workshops, and host hackathons. These gatherings helps build real community: students get to network, learn new skills, showcase their work, and get inspiration straight from people who have walked the path before.

**Social Media**: Like it or not, today's youth spend a lot of time on social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube. Bodhya will reach the students wherever they are, sharing stories from workshops, meetups, and conferences to help more students discover new possibilities in tech.

All of these programs will closely follow [FOSS United's](https://fossunited.org/) vision, leveraging benefits from initiatives like FOSS Clubs, City Communities, and Event Grants.

Starting January 2026, I will begin this experiment full-time, which also means December 2025 will be my last month at FOSS United Foundation as full-time staff. I will remain a volunteer for FOSS United and OASIS, and will connect with the community during major events like IndiaFOSS.

Today, Bihar is at a crossroads. Government initiatives promise new industries, investment in AI and startups, better infrastructure, and more jobs. But as every young Bihari knows, real change comes from the ground up. Bodhya's strength is its direct connection to students: building skills, creating jobs, and keeping the talent local.

## Sustainability

Bodhya is aiming to sustain itself through tech consultancy services, and industry collaborations, ensuring this initiative keeps growing and scaling.
