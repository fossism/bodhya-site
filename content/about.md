Bodhya emerged from a simple observation: Bihar has talented students, but they lack access to tech opportunities and networks that students in metros take for granted.

## Our Story

Over 5+ years of building Free and Open Source Software communities across India at [FOSS United](https://fossunited.org), [Vishal Arya](https://in.linkedin.com/in/fossdot) came to understand something crucial: Open Source could help level the playing field. FOSS isn't just about code, it's about removing barriers. No geographic limits. No gatekeeping. Pure merit and passion.

When Vishal began connecting Bihar students to FOSS projects, mentors, and peers, the response told him something important: students didn't need charity, they needed access and confidence.

That realization shaped Bodhya.

Starting January 2026, Vishal is committing full-time to Bodhya, stepping away from his full-time role as Program Director role at FOSS United Foundaion. As someone from Bihar, he believes deeply that world-class tech talent exists here, it simply needs the right opportunities to flourish.

## Who's Behind This?

Bodhya is powered by an incredible ecosystem:

- **FOSS United team & community**: Mentorship, resources, and institutional support as I continue volunteering for FOSS United and community events like IndiaFOSS
- **Industry mentors & volunteers**: Professionals across India who believe in Bihar's potential and contribute their time and expertise
- **Community builders & educators**: People passionate about tech democratization and regional growth

This isn't a one-person show—it's a community built on shared belief that Bihar deserves world-class tech opportunities.

We will soon list the names of active volunteers here.

## The Name

*Bodhya* means "worthy of knowledge" or "capable of being awakened" in Sanskrit. It reflects our belief that every student has potential—they just need the right spark and opportunity.
