Bodhya emerged from a simple observation: Bihar has talented students, but they lack access to tech opportunities and networks that students in metros take for granted.

## Our Story

After 5+ years building FOSS communities across India at FOSS United, I realized something crucial: Open Source could be a powerful equalizer. FOSS isn't just about code—it's about removing barriers. No geographic limits. No gatekeeping. Pure merit and passion.

I started experimenting with connecting Bihar students to FOSS projects, mentors, and peers. The response was overwhelming. Students didn't need charity—they needed access and confidence.

That's when I decided: I'm going all-in on this.

Starting January 2026, I'm leaving my full-time, Program Director role at [FOSS United](https://fossunited.org/) to dedicate myself entirely to Bodhya. This is personal. I'm a Bihar native, and I'm committed to proving that world-class tech talent doesn't need to leave home to thrive.

## Who's Behind This?

Bodhya is powered by an incredible ecosystem:

- **FOSS United team & community**: Mentorship, resources, and institutional support as I continue volunteering for FOSS United and community events like IndiaFOSS
- **Industry mentors & volunteers**: Professionals across India who believe in Bihar's potential and contribute their time and expertise
- **Community builders & educators**: People passionate about tech democratization and regional growth

This isn't a one-person show—it's a community built on shared belief that Bihar deserves world-class tech opportunities.

We will soon list the names of active volunteers here.

## The Name

*Bodhya* means "worthy of knowledge" or "capable of being awakened" in Sanskrit. It reflects our belief that every student has potential—they just need the right spark and opportunity.

## Let's Build Together

Whether you're a student, educator, industry professional, or just someone who believes in Bihar's potential—[there's a place for you here](/get-involved).
