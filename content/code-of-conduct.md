# CODE OF CONDUCT
## Message from the organisers

We invite you to join events organized by XAANEN our discourse forum, Telegram channels, and other community gatherings in a spirit of curiosity, friendliness, open-mindedness, and respect. XAANEN CONSULTING (OPC) PRIVATE LIMITED is a platform for collaboration, for building free software and open communities, and to ensure the quality of such conversations, there are certain rules that we, and you, are expected to follow. All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## The short version

XAANEN CONSULTING (OPC) PRIVATE LIMITED is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants, volunteers, sponsors or anyone else associated with the community in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any of our events, including talks, webinars, and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the foundation.

If you feel uncomfortable or harassed at any of our events or communication channels, please report it to the foundation using the procedures mentioned in the Code of Conduct.

## The not so short version

* Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or non-verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of the event, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
* Participants asked to stop any such behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
* If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the Bodhya team may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.
* The code of conduct and anti-harassment policies apply to everyone participating in the event including sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organisers, and Bodhya staff.
* Regardless of the event being a virtual or online-only event, we expect participants to adhere to these rules at all avenues, online and offline alike.
